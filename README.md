# AlgorithmBias
This repository contains a jupyter notebook that attempts to examine the effects of classification bias on various different machine learning algorithms. After this initial examination I then attempt to rectify this bias using TomekLinks.

The notebook contains a detailed description of how TomekLinks work and the effect they may have on bias.
